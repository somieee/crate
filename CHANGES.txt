Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

- Implemented a `Ready` node status JMX metric expressing if the node is ready
  for processing SQL statements.

- Added support for CSV file inputs in `COPY FROM` statements. Input type can be
  set using the file's extension or using the optional `WITH` clause and
  specifying the `format`.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that caused the ``percentile`` aggregation to fail if an array
  containing a single item was passed as ``fractions``.

- Fixed an issue which resulted in an exception when a routing column was
  compared against a sub-query inside a ``WHERE`` clause.

- Fixed a performance regression resulting in a table scan instead of a NO-MATCH
  if a sub-query used inside a ``WHERE`` clause returns no result
  (https://github.com/crate/crate/issues/6773).
